========
fping.py
========

Python library that uses the fping executable as its ping engine.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.7 on Linux or Mac OS X (Python 3.5 compatibility is in the works,
  but not there yet.)
* netaddr library (e.g. pip install netaddr)
* Custom, forked build of fping (see Installation).

Installation
============

This library requires a forked version of fping, that has an added option to
output the basic alive, unreachable and unresolvable hosts in CSV format.

* Go to https://github.com/NetworkEng/fping and follow the installation
  instructions there to compile and install the custom version. Since you will
  be downloading the files directly from github, DO NOT skip step 1.
  Download Link: https://github.com/NetworkEng/fping/archive/develop.tar.gz
* If you have issues running autogen.sh, please make sure that you have 
  installed the automake package that is appropriate for your Linux
  distribution.
* For Mac OS X you will need:

    * Xcode installed from the app store (launch it via gui at least once
      after install)
    * Xcode command line developer tools via 'xcode-select --install'
    * Accept the command line license agreement via
      'sudo xcodebuild -license accept'
    * Install homebrew, and then use 'brew install automake'

Once the fping executable has been compiled and installed, simply use pip
to install the fping package from pypi.python.org.  e.g.::

    pip install fping

Usage
=====

Though this is a work in progress, in its current state, this script is 
intended to be a library that is called and executed either in the (i)python 
interpreter / shell, or imported and used by another python script.

    Examples:
        >>> from fping import FastPing
        >>> fp = FastPing()
        >>> fp.ping(filename='testing')
        # cmd =  ['/usr/local/sbin/fping', '-nV', '8.8.8.8',
                  'www.google.com', '206.190.36.45', 'localhost',
                  'host.cannotresolve.com']
        {'host.cannotresolve.com': 'unresolvable',
        'pa-in-f99.1e100.net': 'alive',
        'google-public-dns-a.google.com': 'alive',
        'localhost': 'unreachable',
        'ir1.fp.vip.gq1.yahoo.com': 'alive'}
        >>> fp.hosts(filename='testing', status='alive')
        'pa-in-f99.1e100.net': 'alive',
        'google-public-dns-a.google.com': 'alive',
        'ir1.fp.vip.gq1.yahoo.com': 'alive'}
        >>> fp.alive
        ['pa-in-f99.1e100.net',
        'google-public-dns-a.google.com',
        'ir1.fp.vip.gq1.yahoo.com']
        >>> fp.dead
        ['localhost']
        >>> fp.noip
        ['host.cannotresolve.com']
        >>>
